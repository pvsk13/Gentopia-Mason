INFO:root:Large Language Models (LLMs) are very large deep learning models that are pre-trained on vast amounts of data. They are AI systems capable of understanding and generating human language by processing vast amounts of text data. These models are based on transformers, a type of neural network that is good at understanding the context of language. They can comprehend and generate human language text. However, they also pose certain security risks. For more detailed information, you can check out these resources:
